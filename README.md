# 1.30 website
 Reflection:
 
 Making this website has been a massive learning curve for me and I enjoyed it thoroughly. The production process began with constructing a prototype website using pen and paper. This helped me narrow down what I wanted to do with the website and how I wanted to position content. It gave me some direction once I started working on brackets. As I am new to coding what I had down on paper was a little out of my reach with the skill set I have. Due to this I had to make some changes and experiment different things. The main process I undertook was idea, research and then try to implement on my website. I did struggle with complicated code so tried to keep it fair simple. Looking back, I wish I spent more time understanding grid templates and how the grid is used to position content on your web page. If I done this, I would have done better at fulfilling my prototype design on my actual website instead of having to change things. Upon reflection, I should have spent more time making my website responsive to different screen sizes. Even though my website works on all screens, more time should have been spent to make it mobile friendly. Once I gained a basic understanding of HTML and CSS I started to really enjoy experimenting with my webpage and seeing what I could do.
