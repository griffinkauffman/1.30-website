                <h2>Canberra Art Biennial 2022</h2>
                <p>1 - 29 OCTOBER 2022</p>
                <p>The 2022 edition sees the festival rebranded as Canberra Art Biennial, and sees expansion to the National Arboretum (contour 656), the University of Canberra (contour 606) as well as maintaining and building further on our presence in North and South Canberra, centred on contour 556, the height above sea level of Lake Burley Griffin. </p>
                <p> Canberra Art Biennial extends across Canberra’s public spaces, and we are excited to partner with more private and public gallery / cultural spaces in inner north and south Canberra. </p>
                <p>Neil Hobbs is the creative director for the contour 556 and contour 656 areas, with support from Heeseon Jung and the contour 556 board. The contour 606 satellite event will be co-curated by University of Canberra staff members Associate Professor Julian Raxworthy, discipline lead of the landscape architecture program and Ben Ennis-Butler, senior lecturer and Program Core Coordinator, Design. </p>
                <p> University of Canberra joins us as a major sponsor and supporter - The Faculty of Arts and Design students have revisited our logo and graphic branding, and we are delighted to have Julian and Ben contribute to the event.

                    Artists will be responding to the designed city of Canberra: represented by Australia’s political, cultural and physical history. The event engages people of all ages and abilities, delighting, puzzling and encouraging interaction with art and public space. </p>

                <h2>Contour 556/ 018</h2>
                <p> 5-18 OCTOBER 2018 </p><br>
                <p>A free public art event over three weeks presenting artworks and performances by 60 artists in the world famous public realm and national cultural icons around Lake Burley Griffin, Canberra. contour is unique in the field of public sculpture and performance events as it takes place in a consciously designed and culturally layered landscape, in one of only three designed capital cities.</p>


                <p>The festival site is a place with deep cultural and heritage overlays. All artworks and performances are site specific, drawing inspiration from or reflecting on the cultural or physical character of Canberra. The sense of place of the Canberra lakeside landscape resonates with the artworks and performances. The connections to Canberra’s history provoke a variety of responses from the public that embed a memory of place. The event reinforces the beauty of the designed landscape, and recognises landscapes hidden from view through design. It presents stories of Australia political, cultural and physical history. It includes stories from all Australians, from our past and our future.</p>

                <h2>contour 556/ 016</h2>
                <p> 21 October - 13 November 2016 </p><br>
                <p>Contour 556 was curated by Neil Hobbs, with assistance from the contour 556 team: Karina Harris, Jordan Evans-Tse, Bronwyn Blake and Georgia Hobbs. The inaugural Contour 556 was a case study for Neil’s PhD research project on ‘the transformative nature of public art on the public realm.’ Artworks and performances linked in some way to Canberra’s cultural and political history.Contour 556 saw 41 artworks and performances by 48 local, national and international artists installed on the lake shore and around the Kingston Arts Precinct. The artworks transformed iconic designed landscapes within the central lake area such as Bowen Park, Central Basin, The National Library foyer and forecourt, the National Gallery of Australia Sculpture Garden, Megalo Print Studios and the Fitters Workshop. The artworks included light, sound and digital projections and added vibrancy to the lake edge and parkland. One of the works, Katy Mutton’s dazzle camouflage boat ‘In Plain Sight’ will remain visible on Lake Burley Griffin (and available for hire by the public) for 12 months.</p>

                <p>Of the 48 participating artists 33 were from the Canberra region, 13 from Brisbane, Tweed Heads, Sydney, Southern Highlands or Melbourne, and 2 international artists, from China and Germany.</p>
