            <h2>Contour 556 is Canberra's biennial public art festival, curated by Neil Hobbs. </h2>
            <br>

            <p>Contour 556 is the water level of Lake Burley Griffin, which links the event in name as well as in purpose to the history of the central Canberra landscape. The artworks and installations selected for the festival respond in some way to Canberra’s history, from 50,000 years to the present day. contour 556 will therefore offer the Canberra, Australian and international community a unique opportunity to engage with and understand the layers of Canberra’s history through art.</p>

            <h2>City Commissions</h2>
            <h3>-is one of seven initiatives that artsACT is delivering as part of the Creative Recovery and Resilience Program.</h3>
            <p>artsACT is delivering the project to further its goals for recovery and resilience of the local arts sector following disruption due to the ongoing pandemic. The Creative Recovery and Resilience Program aims to pilot new models of delivering arts industry support; and to identify ongoing and emergent needs of the arts sector.
                contour 556 is delivering the City Commissions project on behalf of artsACT. </p>

            <h2>Project objectives and values</h2><br>
            <p>Through artsACT, the program has a dual focus – recovery and resilience. Recovery can occur with a return to public engagement and resumption of activities, supported by public funding. Resilience will grow the capabilities of arts practitioners and take advantage of other forms of engagement that have emerged due to the technological and societal changes caused by our response to the pandemic.
            </p><br>
            <p> The specific outcomes of the project are:</p>
            <ul1>
                <li>To deliver tangible benefits to the artist through connection with the mentor</li>
                <li> To develop artist skills and experience</li>
                <li> To develop experience on working on a commissioned work</li>
                <li>To deliver tangible benefits to the community groups and the artists.</li>
                <li> To establish and maintain cultural safety</li>
                <li> To be environmentally and socially sustainable</li>

                <p>HIT PRINT! will provide the group of artists with an opportunity to reflect on ways the pandemic has impacted upon their lives. The collaborative exploration will prompt the artists to generate a series of prints based on their individual experiences with a collective overall outcome. </p>
